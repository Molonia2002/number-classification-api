# Number Classification API
Number Classification API
Overview The Number Classification API is a FastAPI-based service that takes a number as input and returns various mathematical properties, including primality, parity, perfect number status, Armstrong number status, and the sum of its digits. Additionally, it fetches a fun fact about the number from an external API. Features Accepts GET requests with a number parameter. Returns JSON responses with the number’s classification details. Handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Properly formatted error handling for invalid inputs. Hosted on Railway for public accessibility.
